Root cause of the "does nothing" perception, once oninput was in place, turned out to be the 1 mm default jog step: F=300 vs F=3000 over 1 mm both complete in a blink. Works clearly at 10 mm / 100 mm step. Hardware-verified at 1 % vs 100 %. FEED and TOOL intentionally left on onchange (their emit path still needs the debounce).',
